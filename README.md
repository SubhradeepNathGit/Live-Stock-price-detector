# Live Stock Price Detector

## Overview

The **Live Stock Price Detector** project is designed to predict and monitor stock prices in real-time using machine learning models. The system is built to analyze historical stock data, make predictions about future prices, and provide live updates. This repository contains all the necessary files for training, deploying, and running the live stock price detection model.

## Repository Structure

- **Procfile**: A file that specifies the commands that are executed by the application on startup. This is particularly useful when deploying the app on platforms like Heroku.

- **Stock Price Predictor.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of the machine learning model used for predicting stock prices. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

- **app.py**: A Python script that acts as the main application file. It handles user inputs, runs the prediction model, and outputs the predicted stock prices.

- **model.pkl**: A serialized file that contains the trained model saved using the `pickle` module. This model can be loaded for quick predictions without retraining.

- **requirement.txt** & **requirements.txt**: Files that list all the dependencies and packages needed to run the project. Either of these can be used to install the necessary Python packages.

- **utils.py**: A utility script that contains helper functions used throughout the project, such as data preprocessing and other auxiliary tasks.

## Features

- **Real-Time Stock Price Prediction**: Utilizes a machine learning model to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The `app.py` script provides a simple interface for users to input stock data and receive real-time predictions.

- **Deployable**: Includes a `Procfile` for easy deployment on cloud platforms like Heroku.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SubhradeepNathGit/Live-Stock-price-detector.git
   cd Live-Stock-price-detector
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Model Training**: To train the model on your own data:

   - Open the `Stock Price Predictor.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
   - Load your dataset and run the cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

2. **Live Prediction**: To use the model for real-time stock price prediction:

   - Run the `app.py` script:

     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

   - Input the necessary stock data as prompted.
   - The application will provide real-time predictions based on the trained model.
